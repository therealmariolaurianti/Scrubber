# Scrubber
XAML Scrubber


Handy tool that formats and orders controls inside multiple xaml files by cleaning up messy formatting and incorrect tab order making files easier to read and manage.

A small portion of code was taken from Kaxaml (awesome tool) -> link to repo: https://github.com/thinkpixellab/kaxaml
